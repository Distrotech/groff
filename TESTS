This file gives information on the tests that were made during the
Automake migration.

Environment
-----------
Arch Linux x64 with:
  - Autoconf 2.69
  - Automake 1.14.1
  - GNU Make 4.0

Current status
--------------
  - Gnulib integrated
  - Minimum Automake support

Tests
-----

1. Generation of build system files

./bootstrap

Generated the following files and directories:
  INSTALL
  Makefile.in
  aclocal.m4
  autom4te.cache/
  build-aux/
  configure
  gnulib_m4/
  lib/
  src/include/config.hin

2. Build of various targets

Tests done in 2 configurations:

  - Out-of source build mode

    mkdir build
    cd build
    ../configure

  - In source build:
    ../configure

2.1 make

  - src/include/config.h generated
  - lib/libgnu.a generated

2.2 make clean

The following files remains (this is expected):
  - src/include/config.h
  - src/include/stamp-h1

2.3 make dist

  groff-1.22.2.tar.gz is generated

  - Files/directories that are not distributed on purpose:
    .gitignore
    .gitmodules
    bootstrap
    bootstrap.conf
    gnulib/
    README.git
    TESTS

  - Missing files/directories (TODO):
    arch/
    contrib/
    doc/
    font/
    man/
    src/* (except include)
    tmac
    test-groff.in

  - Files/directories not present in the git tree that are
    distributed:
    build-aux/
    gnulib_m4/
    lib/
    src/include/config.hin
    INSTALL
    Makefile.in
    aclocal.m4
    configure   

Notes
-----

  - Gnulib: some files of src/libs/libgroff could be replaced by their
    gnulib equivalent
