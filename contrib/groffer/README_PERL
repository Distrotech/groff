README_PERL

`groffer' is written in the programming language Perl.


Compatibility

It was written in Linux, but due to Free Software under GNU it is
available for each operating system.

For testing, `groffer.pl' may be used directly without a Makefile.  By
`make', this file will be transformed into the file `groffer' that will
be installed.


Temporary files

The `file' and `so' temporaries are numbered and the files with .so
request are copied.  All .so requests are handled; this is an
extension to `man' that deals only with the first .so request.
