This file contains information that supplements the generic
installation instructions in file `INSTALL'.  It is meant for
people building directly from the development repository, rather than
a release or snapshot tarball.

If you want to start compiling the `groff' system with an existing
script `configure' you won't need the information in this file. You
need them only if you want to build groff from the git repository.

1. Initial build
----------------

You will need autoconf version and 2.65 or higher and automake version
1.12.2 or higher. These minimal versions are set in the bootstrap.conf
file.

On operating systems supporting concurrent installation of multiple
versions of the autotools, set the following environment variables:

  export AUTOMAKE_VERSION=1.12
  export AUTOCONF_VERSION=2.65

First invoke the bootstrap script:

    $ ./bootstrap

This will:
  
  - clone the gnulib repository as a git submodule in 'gnulib', add
    the needed gnulib sources files in 'lib', add the needed gnulib m4
    macros in 'gnulib_m4'

  - Invoke autoreconf that will call all the `GNU autotools'
    (`aclocal', `autoconf', `automake') in the right order for
    creating the following files:

    -- INSTALL (a symlink to gnulib's INSTALL file)
    -- Makefile.in
    -- aclocal.m4
    -- autom4te.cache/
    -- build-aux/ (that contains all the helper scripts) 
    -- configure
    -- src/include/config.hin

Note that aclocal.m4 is generated and the groff m4 macros are included
via the acinclude.m4 file.
  
At this point you can invoke the `configure' script (that generates
the `config.status' script; it is the `config.status' script generates
the Makefile) and call 'make' to build the groff project. You can do
it in the source tree:

<<<<<<< HEAD
To update file `aclocal.m4', run the shell command
=======
    $ ./configure
    $ make
>>>>>>> Fixes after final complete tests:

You can also build groff in an out of source build tree, which is cleaner:

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ ../configure
    $ make

Note that parallel build is also supported and make can be invoked
with the -j option, which will greatly speed up the build.

Notes:

If you use an old `autoreconf' version < 2.69, there might be an error
warning like:

  /usr/share/aclocal/gtkglextmm-1.2.m4:225:
    warning: underquoted definition of AC_GTKGLEXTMM_SUPPORTS_MULTIHEAD
  /usr/share/aclocal/gtkglextmm-1.2.m4:225:
    run info '(automake)Extending aclocal'
  /usr/share/aclocal/gtkglextmm-1.2.m4:225:
    or see http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/automake.html#Extending-aclocal

Just ignore this.  It doesn't occur in the actual versions of
`autoreconf'.


<<<<<<< HEAD
    $ autoconf -I m4
=======
>>>>>>> Fixes after final complete tests:

2. Modification of autotools files
----------------------------------

Previously, when groff used `autoconf' only and not `automake', you
had to invoke manually the autotools, depending on what you
modified. For example, to change the file `aclocal.m4', you had to run
the shell command 'aclocal -I m4', to recreate the files `configure'
and `Makefile', you had to use the command 'autoreconf -I m4'.

Now, as groff uses `automake', you don't need to run `autoreconf'. If
you make some changes in Makefile.am or configure.ac, all the files
that need to be updated will be regenerated when you execute `make'.



3. Quick start on the usage of `automake' in groff
--------------------------------------------------

A little document explaining the basics of automake and its usage in
groff is available in doc/automake.mom. It is currently not
automatically generated, to build it:

pdfmom automake.mom > automake.pdf

<<<<<<< HEAD
After the use of the `GNU autotools', the usual compilation should
work.  If the run of `configure' produces error reports you have
produced errors in the `autotools' modification.
